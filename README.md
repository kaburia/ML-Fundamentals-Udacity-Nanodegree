## Project 1
### Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

This project employs the AutoGluon library to tackle the Bike Sharing Demand Kaggle competition. 
Through Tabular Prediction, multiple model iterations were trained using provided CSV data. 
The initiative demonstrates proficiency in AutoGluon, yielding enhanced demand prediction crucial for optimizing services in ride-sharing and delivery sectors. 
The outcomes encompass multiple competition entries, securing a commendable Kaggle rank. 
A comprehensive report details the journey, suitable for sharing on Kaggle or personal platforms, thus showcasing valuable expertise in data-driven problem-solving. 
This endeavour underscores the significance of accurate demand forecasting in enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction for industry players like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash.

## Project 3
### Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media 2.0!

This project leverages the skills acquired in the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) course to develop a landmark classifier, aiming to address the challenge of inferring location data for photos lacking metadata. 
Photo-sharing services benefit from location information for improved user experiences. Without available metadata, the absence of location can be mitigated by detecting and classifying landmarks in images. 
Human judgment is infeasible due to the vast number of images and landmarks. 
The project encompasses an end-to-end machine learning process. Initial steps involve data preprocessing, followed by the design and training of multiple CNN models. 
These models' accuracies are subsequently compared to identify the most effective one. 
The ultimate goal is to deploy an application based on the best-performing CNN, enabling automated prediction of image locations based on depicted landmarks. 
By addressing the challenge of missing metadata, the project showcases the potential of CNNs in enriching user experiences and enhancing the utility of photo sharing and storage services. 
This endeavor is crucial in facilitating advanced features like tag suggestions and automated photo organization, thereby highlighting the practical value of machine learning in real-world scenarios.

## Project 4
